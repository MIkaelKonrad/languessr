## Description

LangGuessr is a Browser game inspired by Geoguessr. However in LangGuessr not your geographical but your linguistic skills are being tested.

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible, with a maximum 25'000 points per game. Each game is divided into 5 rounds. In each round the player is assigned a mp3 snippet of a person talking
in his or her dialect. The player than has to guess on a map, where the speaker originates from. The further the players guess is from, where the speaker originates, the less points will be awarded in that round.
The points are then added up over 5 rounds to give the end score.
